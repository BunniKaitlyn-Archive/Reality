# Reality
A highly abstract and modular Unreal Engine mod loader for the 20th century, written in C#.

# Why?
Other Unreal Engine mod loaders aren't really mod loaders, they just load DLLs from a directory and call it a mod loader. Reality *will* be different, not only does it load .NET DLLs/assemblies, it also provides various utilities to help you create mods for Unreal Engine games!
